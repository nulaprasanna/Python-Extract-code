        Summary:
            Extracts table information from Teradata and saves / executes the appropriate files

        Args:
            abs_path (str): Absolute path where you want your scripts to reside and data and pickled subdirectories made
            table_name (str): Teradata table name you wish to query
            env (str): Environment that you want to connect to. (People usually have a testing and production environment)
            db (str): Database name to connect to
            nrows (int): *default = -1* The default of -1 means ALL rows. Otherwise, you can specificy a subset of rows such as 20
            connector (str): *default = 'teradata'* The default uses the teradata python module to connect to the cluster. Valid options include 'teradata' and 'pyodbc'
            columns (list(str)): *default = []* Subset of columns to use, default is all of the columns found in the metadata, however subsets can be selected by passing in ['col1','col2','col3']
            clean_and_pickle (bool): *default = True* Refers to if you want to read the resulting data file into memory to clean and then serialize in your pickled subdirectory
            partition_key (str): *default = ''* There is no partitioning by default. When you define a partition key, it MUST BE A DATE COLUMN AS DEFINED IN TERADATA. This breaks up the exporting
                                    into paritions by the *partition_type* argument. This generates multiple fexp scripts and executes them in parrelel using the available cores. This helps to break
                                    up extremely large datasets or increase speed. When a parition key is defined, after all of the partition files are finished loading from Teradata, the resulting data
                                    is COMBINED into a SINGLE DATA FILE and finishes processing through the following cleaning, data type specification, and serializing.
            partition_type (str): *default = 'year'* Default is to partition the partition_key by distict YEAR. Valid options include "year" or "month"
            suppress_text(bool): *default = 'False'* Default is not to suppress the fast export SQL text.

        Returns:
            Column list recieved from the metadata if clean_and_pickle is set to False, else nothing. Column names are returned in this case so you can save them and use them to read the raw data file
                later with appropriate columns.
